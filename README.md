## Wallet as a Service Abstraction Layer

**One API to rule them all.** Stop building wallet integrations from scratch. OurPocket provides a unified API layer between your applications and multiple third-party wallet/payment providers.

## ðŸŽ¯ The Problem We Solve

Building wallet functionality means:

- Integrating with multiple payment providers individually
- Managing different API specifications and quirks
- Handling provider downtime and failover logic
- Weeks of development time for basic wallet features
- Maintaining multiple integrations as APIs change
